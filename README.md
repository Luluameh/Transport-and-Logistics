I recently had the opportunity or should i say i got blessed to apply for a React internship position, and as part of the application process, I was required to complete a React test. The test was designed to assess my skills and knowledge of React and web development in general.

In this README, I'll be sharing my experience and the challenges I faced while working on the React test.
The React test comprised a series of tasks that required me to build a web application without a settings for mobile view using React.
The application was strickly on finding my skills on pixels perfect that is to be able to get a perfect size, images and all that was entail by the ui/ux.

The test involved the following tasks:
\*working on a Transport and Logistics webflow website

Challenges Faced
Hmmm the challenges i face was quite out of the regular although i dont see it as a challenges again instead a draw to the my capabilities and capacity to work under pressure and and also to be able to create and thing of ways to solve and face my million thoughts and fears .

-Time Constraints : At first the time was short but i want to say thank you to the Team for extending the time of submission it helped me in fixing some of my codes issues(bugs and errors)

Conclusion
Overall, the React test was a challenging but rewarding experience. I was able to showcase my skills and knowledge of React and web development in general. The test also gave me the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.
And ooo the Ui/ux designers like wow the design of the work helped to cover every aspect and areas of coding
I want to Thank the whole Team at Nupat Technology for this it was worth it and a wake up call to do more .
